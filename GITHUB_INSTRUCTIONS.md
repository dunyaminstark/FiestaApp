# Instructions for Putting Your App on GitHub

Follow these steps to create a GitHub repository and push your code to it:

## 1. Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.

## 2. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter "FiestaApp" as the repository name
4. (Optional) Add a description for your repository
5. Choose whether the repository should be public (anyone can see it) or private (only you and people you invite can see it)
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license as we already have these files locally
7. Click "Create repository"

## 3. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. Follow the "push an existing repository from the command line" section.

Run these commands in your terminal (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FiestaApp.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 4. Verify Your Repository on GitHub

1. Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FiestaApp`
2. You should see your code and README.md file on GitHub

## 5. Future Changes

For future changes to your code, use these commands to push them to GitHub:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push
```
