# Image Persistence Solution in FiestaApp

This document outlines the solution implemented to ensure that custom images persist across app restarts in the FiestaApp.

## Problem

The original implementation had an issue where custom images uploaded by users would not persist after the app was closed and reopened. This was because:

1. The app was storing content URIs (e.g., `content://media/external/images/media/123`) in SharedPreferences
2. These content URIs might not be accessible after app restart due to:
   - Permission issues (permissions might be lost after app restart)
   - The URI might point to a temporary location
   - The underlying file might be moved or deleted by the system or user

## Solution

The solution involves copying selected images to the app's internal storage and storing URIs to those locations instead. This ensures that:

1. The images are owned by the app and persist until the app is uninstalled
2. No special permissions are needed to access the images after app restart
3. The images won't be moved or deleted by the system or other apps

### Implementation Details

The solution consists of the following components:

1. **ImageStorageManager**: A utility class that handles:
   - Copying images from content URIs to internal storage
   - Deleting images from internal storage when they're no longer needed
   - Checking if a URI points to an image in internal storage

2. **Updated EditHolidayDialog**: The dialog now:
   - Uses ImageStorageManager to save selected images to internal storage
   - Deletes old images from internal storage when they're replaced
   - Cleans up unsaved images when the dialog is dismissed
   - Handles both predefined images and custom images

3. **Proper Cleanup Logic**: The implementation includes cleanup logic to:
   - Delete old images when they're replaced with new ones
   - Delete unsaved images when the dialog is dismissed
   - Delete original images when they're replaced and the changes are saved

### Key Changes

1. **Created ImageStorageManager Utility Class**:
   - `saveImageToInternalStorage`: Copies an image from a content URI to internal storage
   - `deleteImageFromInternalStorage`: Deletes an image from internal storage
   - `isInternalStorageUri`: Checks if a URI points to an image in internal storage

2. **Updated Image Selection Process**:
   - When a user selects an image from the gallery, it's copied to internal storage
   - The URI of the saved image is stored in the Holiday object
   - The original content URI is not stored

3. **Added Cleanup Logic**:
   - When a user selects a new image, the old one is deleted from internal storage
   - When a user cancels the dialog, any unsaved images are deleted
   - When a user saves changes, any replaced images are deleted

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added try-catch blocks to handle potential errors during image operations
   - Added logging to help diagnose issues
   - Added fallbacks to ensure the app continues to function even if image operations fail

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Image Persistence**: Custom images now persist reliably across app restarts
2. **Improved User Experience**: Users can upload custom images and see them consistently
3. **Efficient Storage Management**: Old and unused images are automatically cleaned up
4. **Robust Error Handling**: The app handles errors gracefully and provides fallbacks

## Technical Details

The implementation uses Android's internal storage system, which provides a private storage area for each app. Files stored in this area:

1. Are accessible only to the app that created them
2. Are automatically deleted when the app is uninstalled
3. Don't require any special permissions to access

The solution uses file:// URIs instead of content:// URIs, which are more reliable for persistent access.

## Conclusion

This solution ensures that custom images persist across app restarts, providing a better user experience and more reliable functionality. The implementation is robust, handles errors gracefully, and manages storage efficiently.
