# Warnings Fixed in FiestaApp

This document outlines the warnings that were identified and fixed in the FiestaApp codebase.

## 1. Fixed TODO Comment in TopBar.kt

### Problem
The TopBar component had a TODO comment for handling flag selection, which was causing a warning.

### Solution
Implemented a proper handler for flag selection by:
- Adding state to track the selected flag
- Updating the FlagSelector to use the selected flag
- Implementing the onFlagSelected callback to update the state

### Benefits
- Removed the warning
- Improved code completeness
- Added proper state management for flag selection

## 2. Fixed Redundant Import in HolidayCard.kt

### Problem
HolidayCard.kt had a redundant import for HolidayImage from the same package:
```
import com.dunyamin.fiestaapp.ui.components.HolidayImage
```

### Solution
Removed the redundant import since HolidayImage is in the same package as HolidayCard.

### Benefits
- Removed the warning
- Improved code cleanliness
- Reduced unnecessary imports

## 3. Fixed Unused Imports in HolidaySwiper.kt

### Problem
HolidaySwiper.kt had unused imports:
```
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxWidth
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.height
```

### Solution
Removed the unused imports since they were not used in the code.

### Benefits
- Removed the warnings
- Improved code cleanliness
- Reduced unnecessary imports

## Conclusion

These fixes have eliminated all warnings in the codebase, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code. The changes were minimal and focused on removing unnecessary code and implementing proper handlers for TODO comments.
