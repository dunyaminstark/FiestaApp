# Git Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Failed to Push Some Refs

### Problem
You encountered the following error when trying to push to GitHub:
```
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/dunyaminstark/FiestaApp.git'
```

### Resolution
The issue has been resolved by pushing with verbose output using:
```
git push -v origin main
```

This successfully pushed all your local commits to GitHub, creating the main branch on the remote repository.

### Common Causes for "Failed to Push" Errors

1. **Remote Has Commits That Local Doesn't Have**
   - This happens when someone else has pushed to the same branch
   - Solution: `git pull` before pushing to integrate their changes

2. **Authentication Issues**
   - GitHub requires authentication for pushes
   - Solution: Ensure you're properly authenticated (using token, SSH key, or password)

3. **Network Issues**
   - Temporary network problems can cause push failures
   - Solution: Try again later or check your internet connection

4. **Branch Protection Rules**
   - Some repositories have rules preventing direct pushes to certain branches
   - Solution: Create a pull request instead of pushing directly

## Future Git Operations

### Pushing Changes
After making changes to your code:
```
git add .                                # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Description of changes"   # Commit changes
git push                                 # Push to GitHub
```

### Pulling Changes
To get changes others have made:
```
git pull
```

### Checking Status
To see what files have been changed:
```
git status
```

### Viewing Commit History
To see the history of commits:
```
