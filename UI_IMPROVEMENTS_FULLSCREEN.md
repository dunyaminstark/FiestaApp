# Fullscreen Card Implementation in FiestaApp

This document outlines the changes made to implement a truly fullscreen card in the FiestaApp, ensuring that the card is not positioned under the TopBar.

## Problem

The original implementation had the HolidayCard positioned below the TopBar in a vertical Column layout. This meant that the card was not truly fullscreen, as it was constrained to the area below the TopBar.

## Solution

The following changes were made to implement a truly fullscreen card:

1. **Layout Structure Change**:
   - Changed the layout from a vertical Column to a Box layout in MainScreen.kt
   - This allows components to be positioned on top of each other, rather than stacked vertically

2. **Component Positioning**:
   - Positioned the HolidaySwiper to fill the entire screen using `modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()`
   - Positioned the TopBar at the top of the screen, overlaying the card, using `modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.TopCenter)`

3. **Component Updates**:
   - Updated the HolidaySwiper component to accept a modifier parameter
   - Updated the TopBar component to accept a modifier parameter
   - This allows for more flexible positioning of these components from the MainScreen

## Benefits

- **True Fullscreen Experience**: The card now extends to the full height of the screen, including the area behind the TopBar
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: The TopBar now appears as an overlay on top of the card, creating a more modern and immersive UI
- **Improved Screen Space Utilization**: The entire screen is now used for content, maximizing the available space for the card

## Implementation Details

The key changes were made in the following files:

1. **MainScreen.kt**:
   - Changed the layout from Column to Box
   - Positioned the HolidaySwiper and TopBar appropriately

2. **HolidaySwiper.kt**:
   - Added a modifier parameter to allow for flexible positioning

3. **TopBar.kt**:
   - Added a modifier parameter to allow for flexible positioning

These changes ensure that the card is truly fullscreen and not positioned under the TopBar, as requested.
