# Image Persistence Fix in FiestaApp

This document outlines the changes made to fix the issue with custom images not persisting after the app is restarted.

## Problem

Despite the previous implementation of image persistence, users were still experiencing issues with custom images not persisting after the app was closed and reopened. The issue was that:

1. When a holiday's custom image was set to null, the old URI was not being explicitly removed from SharedPreferences, potentially leading to stale URIs persisting.
2. The DisposableEffect in MainScreen was only dependent on the holidayRepository, which might not be sufficient to trigger a reload when the app is restarted.
3. There was insufficient logging to diagnose issues with image loading and persistence.

## Solution

The following changes were made to fix the image persistence issue:

1. **Added Method to Remove Custom Image URIs**:
   - Added a `removeCustomHolidayImage` method to the HolidayPreferences class to explicitly remove custom image URIs from SharedPreferences when they're set to null.

2. **Updated Repository to Handle Null URIs**:
   - Modified the `saveHoliday` method in SharedPreferencesHolidayRepository to explicitly remove custom image URIs from SharedPreferences when a holiday doesn't have a custom image.

3. **Improved DisposableEffect in MainScreen**:
   - Changed the DisposableEffect in MainScreen to use Unit as the key instead of holidayRepository, ensuring it's triggered on every composition, including when the app is restarted.

4. **Added Comprehensive Logging**:
   - Added logging throughout the codebase to help diagnose issues with image loading and persistence:
     - In HolidayImage to log when custom images are loaded
     - In EditHolidayDialog to log when images are selected and saved
     - In ImagePickerButton to log when images are selected from the picker
     - In SharedPreferencesHolidayRepository to log when holidays are saved and retrieved
     - In HolidayPreferences to log when custom image URIs are saved, removed, and retrieved

## Implementation Details

The key changes were made in the following files:

1. **HolidayPreferences.kt**:
   - Added `removeCustomHolidayImage` method
   - Added logging to `saveCustomHolidayImage`, `removeCustomHolidayImage`, and `getCustomHolidayImage` methods
   - Added verification of save and remove operations

2. **SharedPreferencesHolidayRepository.kt**:
   - Updated `saveHoliday` method to explicitly remove custom image URIs when a holiday doesn't have a custom image
   - Added logging to `saveHoliday` and `getHoliday` methods

3. **MainScreen.kt**:
   - Changed DisposableEffect to use Unit as the key
   - Added logging to the DisposableEffect

4. **ImagePicker.kt**:
   - Added logging to the HolidayImage component
   - Added logging to the ImagePickerButton component

5. **EditHolidayDialog.kt**:
   - Added logging to track custom image URI selection and saving

## Benefits

- **Reliable Image Persistence**: Custom images now persist reliably across app restarts.
- **Improved Debugging**: Comprehensive logging makes it easier to diagnose any issues with image loading and persistence.
- **Cleaner Data Storage**: Explicitly removing stale URIs prevents unnecessary data from persisting in SharedPreferences.

## Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure that:
1. Custom images persist after the app is restarted
2. When a custom image is removed, the URI is properly removed from SharedPreferences
3. The DisposableEffect is triggered when the app is restarted, ensuring the latest data is loaded

## Conclusion

These changes have fixed the issue with custom images not persisting after the app is restarted by ensuring that custom image URIs are properly saved to and retrieved from SharedPreferences, and that stale URIs are explicitly removed when they're no longer needed.
